notes: Using a baseline helps create a cohesive vertical rythmn and takes the guess work out of the placement of elements. The optimal line-height at standard line-lengths of body text is 22px. The baseline, 11px, is half of this for extra flexibility, but remains related to the text. Major elements should align on this baseline, and preferably on the macro baseline (22px).

<h4>Mirco Baseline (11px)</h4>
<div class="baseline-micro">
	<p>Dear God, I cannot love Thee the way I want to. You are the slim crescent of a moon that I see and my self is the earth’s shadow that keeps me from seeing all the moon. The crescent is very beautiful and perhaps that is all one like I am should or could see; but what I am afraid of, dear God, is that my self shadow will grow so large that it blocks the whole moon, and that I will judge myself by the shadow that is nothing.</p>
	<p>I do not know you God because I am in the way. Please help me to push myself aside.</p>
	<p>I want very much to succeed in the world with what I want to do. I have prayed to You about this with my mind and my nerves on it and strung my nerves into a tension over it and said, “oh God, please,” and “I must,” and “please, please.” I have not asked You, I feel, in the right way. Let me henceforth ask You with resignation—that not being or meant to be a slacking up in prayer but a less frenzied kind, realizing that the frenzy is caused by an eagerness for what I want and not a spiritual trust. I do not wish to presume. I want to love.</p>
