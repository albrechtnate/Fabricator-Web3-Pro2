<p>My generation is special because of what we missed rather than what we got, because in a certain sense <strong>we are the first and the last.</strong> The first to take technology for granted. <em>(What was a space shot to us, except an hour cut from Social Studies to gather before a TV in the gym as Cape Canaveral counted down?)</em> The first to grow up with TV. My sister was 8 when we got our set, so to her it seemed magic and always somewhat foreign. She had known books already and would never really replace them. But for me, the TV set was, like the kitchen sink and the telephone, a fact of life.</p>
